# Web-Scraper-Government-Contracts
Takes link from defense.gov and scrapes the contract date, award amount, and company name. 

Change the amount of names scraped by changing the two variables "pageNumber" and "end" to the desired range of pages, if pageNumber = 1 
then it will grab the first 10 links on that page. It is possible to only grab a certain amount of links within the first page, but
would require editing the argument for the array that the links are added to.
